This repository contains simulation solutions from Decision Analytics class with Prof. Jacquillat.

Problem 1: This problem is to predict the number of people infected, immune and susceptible on each day of the month using monte carlo simulation. The number of people infected is sampled using binomial distribution. 

Problem 2: This problem is to predict how many rooms must be sold each month to maximize the annual revenue. The demand uncertainty is modeled as poison distribution.
